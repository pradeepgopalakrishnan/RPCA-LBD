* Paper Implementation: Foreground Detection based on Low Rank and Block Sparse Matrix Decomposition. This work was done for the course Applied Linear Algebra EE5120 by Prof. Uday Khankhoje at IIT Madras.  

* The core implementation accompanying the paper has been completed. Mind the code quality. The code has to be refactored. The images have to be rendered at higer resolutions which have been left out because of high compute times.
